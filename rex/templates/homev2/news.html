  Dear SVA members, 
</p>
<p>
  As we announced ,  today is the day of launching our App.  However,  with android version 8.0, many people aren't affordable to own it.  So we are building android 7.0 and 6.0. This may take 10 to 14 days to complete it.  We are working hard to bring the best things to our community. Just stay tuned and support us. 
</p>
 
<p>
  Thanks & Best regards!
